# COVID19-Africa-Response
Resources, ideas and infographs around the COVID19 Pandemic


How about we start a call for submissions to collect resources by scientists and makers in Africa and maybe coordinate COVID19-responses by African organisations and influencers?
- collection of infographics on hygiene  measures to avoid infection by designers and scientists
- provide a platform where Research labs can volunteer to run PCR screenings on COVID19 DNA/RNA samples to investigate for mutants and derivates
- makerspaces, coding communities and innovation hubs on the continent to design immediate response hardware and software
- â€¦ (what else)

We / AfricArXiv are preparing a blog post around this and it would be great if we could coordinate this together and share on both website and sociel media channels.
