## Collecting resources 
GoogleDoc open for co-writing and brainstorming: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VrojbQ3B3jSnx1yPCpueJmUynkd3AsjeAnuz0Mw2jFw/

## Addressing Github
How about we start a call for submissions to collect resources by scientists and makers in Africa and maybe coordinate COVID19-responses by African organisations and influencers?
- collection of infographics on hygiene  measures to avoid infection by designers and scientists
- provide a platform where Research labs can volunteer to run PCR screenings on COVID19 DNA/RNA samples to investigate for mutants and derivates
- makerspaces, coding communities and innovation hubs on the continent to design immediate response hardware and software
- … (what else)

We / AfricArXiv are preparing a blog post around this and it would be great if we could coordinate this together and share on both website and sociel media channels. 


Resources, ideas and guidelines around the COVID19 pandemic
What works in other parts of the world might not work in Africa. Let us build a specific resource kit.

Essentials
- Stay calm 
- wash your hands frequently 
- keep a physical distance to other people 
- check on friends and relatives, esp. elderly and vulnerable people 
- collect and share information on best practices
- follow general as well as COVID19-specific hygiene guidance: afro.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus-covid-19 

Online
We need to ensure that #internet providers can keep up and improve their services - #Connectivity is already affected. >> http://africa-internet.com
Collaborate online e.g. coronavirustechhandbook.com/ 
Follow hashtag combinations around #Africa #coronavirus #COVID19 
Mobilize resources and transfer knowledge collected online to offline 
Offline

What you can do 
as a researcher
Submit any COVID-19 relevant research and information toi AfricArXiv as text document (preprint, postprint), presentation (PDF, PPT), infographs (PNG, PDF)
https://info.africarxiv.org/submit/ 
Make lists of available research equipment that might be needed to support authorities
As a makerspace
Make a list of the things you can provide (through 3D printing or other things)
Reach out locally to ask what people need most and see if you can provide that utilizing and deploying Open Source hardware



As a civilian
Ask questions: what do you need to know? What resources and information would you like to get?
…

Relevant resources 
Africa-specific and globally relevant
