## Getting things done #strongertogether
Help us to address our tasks listed as issues in this repo // feel free to add more
- https://github.com/AfricArxiv/COVID19-Africa-Response/issues

- collection of infographics on hygiene  measures to avoid infection by designers and scientists
- provide a platform where Research labs can volunteer to run PCR screenings on COVID19 DNA/RNA samples to investigate for mutants and derivates
- makerspaces, coding communities and innovation hubs on the continent to design immediate response hardware and software
- … (what else)
